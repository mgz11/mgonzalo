             Hello everyone! My name is Miguel Gonzalo and I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of California, Davis. At the time of writing this (08/2/21), 
             I have spent around a total of 2 weeks worth of studying the basics of front-end development. This website was made with HTML, CSS, a bit of Javascript and a bit of Bootstrap 4. 
             It definitely isn't perfect but I just wanted to put some of the things I learned into practice. So far, my experince with programming has been strictly C++ with a bit of MATLAB
             included. I've covered topics such as object-oriented programming and data structures and algorithms. While this has taught me fundamentals of programming and important concepts, it
             hasn't been something I find myself to be passsionate about. However, as of recent, web development and front-end development in general has become something that I've found much more 
             interesting and I'm excited to continue with it!
         </p>
